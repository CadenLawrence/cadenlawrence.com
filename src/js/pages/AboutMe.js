				 and hopefully(depending on certain requirements to take certain classes) to minor in Information Technology with my focus 
				 split between both Software Development and Information Security.</p>
				<h2>The Highlights</h2>

				<p>I was born and raised in Marion with my two siblings(both pictured above). Lindsay has a Bachelors in Graphic Design but honestly is really good at anything she does and is currently a freelance baker. Here is here instagram and here contact(blah blah whatever Linds wants business wise). Jacob is an Ohio State Highway Patrol Trooper and K-9 trainer(link and website here). </p>

				<p>Fast forward to my freshman year of highschool and still the best haircut I have ever had. I have had a pletheria of amazing haircuts in my life but I am absolutely most proud of this one. I will leave the senior picture for a much later and more embarrasing date.</p>
